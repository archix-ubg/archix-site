    <p>
        For those who are wondering why Archix-site is currently down, this was not my decision and the site was taken down.
        However, I do have a copy available here:
        <a href="https://rework-site.vercel.app/https://archix-ubg.github.io/archixubg-site/">
            https://rework-site.vercel.app/https://archix-ubg.github.io/archixubg-site/
        </a>
        — this will work for now.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am also working on your requests and will add them if they are not too difficult.
        Someone suggested Undertale and Deltarune. Currently, Undertale Yellow is the only one I am working on,
        but I am looking into adding Undertale and Deltarune to Archix.

        I am also working with the person who had indexmath to help restore their site
        because I felt bad about hacking their site:
        <a href="https://indexmath-v2.netlify.app">
            https://indexmath-v2.netlify.app
        </a>
    </p>

    <p>
        P.S. I now have a way to clone Archix!
