    <p>
        For those who are wondering why Archix-site is currently down, I have not chosen this and my site got taken down. 
        However, I do have a copy available here:
        <a href="https://rework-site.vercel.app/https://archix-ubg.github.io/archixubg-site/">
            https://rework-site.vercel.app/https://archix-ubg.github.io/archixubg-site/
        </a>
        — this will work for now.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am also working on your requests and will add them if they are not too difficult. 
        Someone suggested Undertale and Deltarune. Currently, Undertale Yellow is the only one I am working on, 
        but I am trying to get Undertale and Deltarune added to Archix.
    </p>

    <p>
        I apologize for the inconvenience. I am working on getting the site fixed.
